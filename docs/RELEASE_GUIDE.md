# Vallum Engine Release Guide

Vallum Engine is managed as a formal product. Each release must update the app, project state, changelog, and product map when the roadmap changes.

## Current deployment

The app deploys from the main branch root through GitHub Pages.

Live path:

https://zencloudau.github.io/vallum-engine/

The current release line is static. There is no build step, package manager, backend, database, or external asset dependency.

## Pre-release check

Before considering a release complete, confirm that the site loads, the campaign starts, choices resolve, dice outcomes display, party health renders, local save works after refresh, ambience starts and stops, and documentation reflects the current state.
